# Introduction
The `zoop` API consists of the following parts:

## `zoop`
Provides basic functions to implement the OOP mechanism in *zig*.

## `zoop.tuple`
Provides zoop with the ability to operate on tuple data, which zoop uses to combine classes and various definitions within interfaces to form new classes and interfaces.

## `IObject`
All classes defined by `zoop` will automatically implement the `IObject` interface.

## `class`
All classes defined by `zoop` contain some basic methods.
