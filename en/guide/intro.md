# Zoop Introduction

## Reasons for Zoop
1. *zig* has no native OOP
2. I really need OOP
3. I like *zig* and definitely use it :wink:

## Design Philosophy
- Performance first
- easy to use
- Keep it simple

## Supported OOP features
- Inheritance (multiple inheritance possible)
- Interface (multiple inheritance possible)
- Virtual methods (through interfaces)
- Method Overriding
- Base interface IObject (all objects can be converted to IObject)
- Runtime type information
- Runtime type conversion (objects can be converted arbitrarily between implemented interfaces and inherited classes)
- Destructor deinit()

## Features that may be supported in the future
- Reflection

## Other
I think of adding :smile:
